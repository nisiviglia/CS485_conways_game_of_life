# Documentation

## What is this?
* This is the folder where we store the config file for Doxygen, as well as the generated documentation.
* [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) is a tool for simplifying and automating documentation of code, which can be easily and quickly generated by anyone with the repo. 

## Contents
### objlib-doxygen
Doxygen configuration file, customized for this project. Easy to read and understand with lots of comments, just really really long.

As a short summary, I've set it so that it generates HTML/LaTeX output from /src/, /include/, and the base README.file, but ignores .c and .h files (you can find UnQLite documentation elsewhere).

### /html
Doxygen output for creating .html documentation. 

### /latex
Doxygen output for creating LaTeX files, which can also be converted into a single PDF document.

### .gitignore
Set so that any generated documentation (/html, /latex) is ignored by Git.  


## Generating documentation via doxygen (in linux)
### Step 1: Install doxygen

```bash
sudo apt-get install doxygen
```
 
### Step 2: Navigate to documentation folder and run doxygen

```bash
cd /PATH/TO/REPO/objlib/doxygen
doxygen objlib-doxygen
```
This will create a /html folder with "fake website" documentation, with the main page at **index.html**.

### Optional step 3: generate PDF from LaTeX
Before running step 2, go inside objlib-doxygen and change the **GENERATE_LATEX** field to **YES** 

```bash
sudo apt-get install doxygen-latex
cd latex
make
```

This will generate a file named **refman.pdf** inside /latex.

## Documenting your code
Doxygen will pull descriptions and code structure from anywhere it can find doxygen-compatible code blocks - see official manual for reference. [WIP]
